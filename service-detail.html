                        <p>Physiotherapists focus on both prevention and rehabilitation.

                            exercising.</p>
                        <p>Sports injuries are common and can occur throughout your body to bones, muscles, tendons,
                            ligaments and other structures. You can treat many minor injuries at home with rest, ice,
                            compression, elevation and over-the-counter pain medications. But some injuries require
                            medical treatment, such as immobilization, physical therapy and surgery.
                        </p>
                        <p>Sports injuries can affect any part of your body. They most often affect: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Achilles tendon:</b> The Achilles tendon is a thick cord that connects the back of
                                your lower leg (calf) to
                                your heel. It helps you walk. But the tendon can become swollen, inflamed and stiff. It
                                can even tear. This is called Achilles tendinitis or Achilles tendon rupture</li>

                            <li><b>Ankle:</b> Your leg and foot join together at your ankle. It contains three joints,
                                as well as several bones, cartilage, ligaments, muscles and tendons. Ankle pain is often
                                caused by a sprained ankle.</li>

                            <li><b>Elbow: </b> Your elbow is the joint that acts as a hinge between your upper and lower
                                arm. People often experience pain in their elbow from repeat motions and overuse (for
                                example, tennis elbow and Little League elbow).</li>

                            <li><b>Head:</b> Your head includes your face, skull and brain. One of the most common head
                                injuries is concussion.</li>

                                lower leg. It contains bones, cartilage, ligaments and tendons. Knee pain can be caused
                                by jumper’s knee or runner’s knee. Other common injuries include meniscus tear and
                                anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear.</li>

                            puts special cups on your skin for a few minutes to create suction. People get it for many
                            purposes, including to help with pain, inflammation, blood flow, relaxation and well-being,
                            and as a type of deep-tissue massage.</p>

                            <li> <b>Dry cupping:</b> The air inside a plastic or glass cup is suctioned or vacuumed out
                                by placing the cup on the skin. In most cases, the cups can be used at rest or while
                                moving.</li>

                            <li> <b>Wet cupping / Hijama / Bleeding:</b> Wet cupping creates a mild suction by leaving a
                                cup in place for about 3 minutes. The therapist then removes the cup and uses a small
                                scalpel to make light, tiny cuts on your skin. Next, they do a second suction to draw
                                out a small quantity of blood.</li>

                            <li> <b>Oil cupping / Sliding cupping:</b> Its a technique where massage oils are applied,
                                cups are attached to the body and then slide across an area.</li>

                            <li> <b>Flash cupping / Empty cupping:</b> It involves quick repeated application of cups,
                                with minimal retention. It reduces local congestion and stimulate circulation over a

                            improve circulation, repair tissues, strengthen muscles, and promote bone.</p>
                        <p>Electrotherapy units usually consist of a battery-powered device connected by wires to
                            adhesive electrode pads which are placed on the skin. The electrode pads are sticky, so they
                            will adhere to the skin. Once the electrodes are attached and the unit is turned on, a mild
                            electric current is sent to the skin via the electrode.
                        </p>
                        <p>A number of newer electrotherapy devices bypass the wires, combining electrodes and battery
                            power into a single unit that can be worn inconspicuously on the back, arm, leg, or
                            elsewhere during work or other daily activities. A hand-held controller is used to adjust
                            the level of stimulation. </p>

                            treatments are supported by research. </p>

                            children.</p>
                        <p>Through this form of preventive health care, women can learn from skilled health personnel
                            about healthy behaviours during pregnancy, better understand warning signs during pregnancy
                            and childbirth, and receive social, emotional and psychological support at this critical
                            time in their lives. Through antenatal care, pregnant women can also access micronutrient
                            supplementation, treatment for hypertension to prevent eclampsia, as well as immunization
                            against tetanus. Antenatal care can also provide HIV testing and medications to prevent
                            mother-to-child transmission of HIV. In areas where malaria is endemic, health personnel can
                            provide pregnant women with medications and insecticide-treated mosquito nets to help
                            prevent this debilitating and sometimes deadly disease.
